# -Covid-19-Data-Analysis
# COVID-19 Data Analysis - Mini Project

This project is a part of the 3MTT Data Science track, focusing on analyzing COVID-19 data to uncover trends and insights. Emphasizing advanced data cleaning methods, particularly machine learning-driven imputation, to ensure data accuracy.

## Overview

Handling real-world data often involves incomplete or messy datasets. Inspired by contemporary data science techniques, I employed machine learning models to predict and fill missing values, which improved the integrity of the analysis.

## Key Highlights

- In-depth exploratory data analysis of COVID-19 datasets
- Developed and applied machine learning models for missing data imputation
- Extracted actionable insights on pandemic trends
- Demonstrated the importance of sophisticated data cleaning in data science

## Technologies Used

- Python
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook
- Visualization libraries (matplotlib / seaborn)

## How to Run

1. Install Python and necessary libraries (`pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`).
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) file in your environment.
3. Run the cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis and insights.

## Notes

- The project showcases how machine learning can be effectively used for data imputation.
- The analysis provides insights into COVID-19 trends and the impact of data quality on these insights.
